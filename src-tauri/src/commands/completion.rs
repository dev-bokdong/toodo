//! Commands that finish a task (see `docs/workflow.md`): recording the commits of its
//! branch, opening its pull request, which pushes the branch, opens (or reuses) a pull
//! request with `gh`, and moves the task to `in_review`, and completing it once that
//! pull request is merged, which closes its herdr workspace (keeping the worktree), moves
//! it to `done`, and releases its dependents.
//!
//! They run on the async runtime because git and gh can take seconds. The database lock
//! is not held while they run.
//!
//! A background thread also moves tasks on its own every minute, telling the frontend
//! through [`TasksChanged`]: it looks up the pull request of the branch of each
//! `in_progress` task and moves the task to `in_review` when one was opened outside
//! Toodo (e.g. by an agent in herdr), then checks the pull requests of `in_review` tasks
//! and completes each task whose pull request was merged, as the `complete_task` command
//! would. For each pull request still open, it keeps the CI and review state and tells
//! the frontend through [`PullRequestStatusesChanged`] when one changes.
//!
