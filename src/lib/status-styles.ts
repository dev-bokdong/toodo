/**
 * The one colour map for states shown across the app: status chips, timeline bars, the
 * legend, banners, and notes. Each tone has a single meaning:
 *
 * - `neutral`: nothing to act on (planned, idle, not adopted).
 * - `info`: something running on its own (agent working, CI running, update available).
 * - `progress`: work in progress.
 * - `review`: waiting in review.
 * - `success`: finished well (done, CI passed, approved).
 * - `attention`: the user can or should act (ready, agent needs input, blocker,
 *   changes requested, a confirm step).
 * - `danger`: something went wrong or is late (past due, CI failed, merge conflicts).
