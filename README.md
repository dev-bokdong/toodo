# Toodo

Toodo is a self-hosted app for planning and shipping code changes: `toodo-server` runs on
a Linux machine and you use it from a browser as an installable web app (PWA). It connects a task plan to
isolated git worktrees, AI-agent implementation sessions in
[herdr](https://herdr.dev), commit tracking, and pull requests. It keeps a timeline of
when each task was planned, started, and completed, so the year's work can be compiled
into a performance report.

## Features

- **Workspaces**: use a local directory or a remote directory on a saved herdr SSH
  machine as a workspace.
- **Planning**: create tasks per workspace; express ordering as dependencies (a DAG).
- **Worktree preparation**: before a task is implemented, create a dedicated
  `git worktree` in a separate directory via the herdr API.
- **Implementation in herdr**: the work itself happens in herdr panes and agents
  attached to the task's worktree.
- **Commit tracking**: record the commits (SHA, message, author, time) made for a task.
- **Completion and PR**: a task's branch is pushed and a pull request opened for it;
  once that pull request is merged on GitHub, Toodo completes the task automatically.
- **Agent planning (MCP)**: coding agents can list tasks, create tasks, and connect
  dependencies through the server's MCP endpoint; copy the client config from Agent
  access in Settings (the gear at the bottom of the sidebar). Agents on SSH machines use
  the same config, through a reverse SSH tunnel the server keeps open to each machine with
  a workspace.
- **Timeline**: every status change is timestamped; the dependency graph is drawn on a
  time axis showing when each task was planned, started, reviewed, and completed.

- [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md): domain model and system components.
- [docs/workflow.md](docs/workflow.md): task lifecycle from planning to pull request.
- [docs/server.md](docs/server.md): installing and running `toodo-server`, the web app, and
  its API.
- [docs/migrate-desktop-data.md](docs/migrate-desktop-data.md): moving the data of the former
  Windows desktop app into a `toodo-server`.

## Requirements

- A Linux machine (x86_64 for release builds) for `toodo-server`
- [herdr](https://herdr.dev), installed and running there (Toodo controls it; it is not bundled)
- Git, OpenSSH, and the GitHub CLI (`gh`) on the server's `PATH`
- A current browser to use the web app

See [docs/server.md](docs/server.md) to install it.

## End-to-End Tests

`e2e/` holds Playwright tests that drive the web app against a
scratch `toodo-server`. Every test starts its own server on a free loopback port with a
temporary data directory, so a run never touches the data of a real server and never binds
the default server ports. A run fails when it leaves a new workspace open in the herdr of
the machine (`e2e/herdr-guard.ts`).
CI runs the suite on pull requests into `dev`
(`.github/workflows/e2e.yml`).

To run it locally (Node, Rust, and a Linux machine):

```sh
npm ci
npx playwright install chromium                       # once
(cd src-tauri && cargo build --bin toodo-server)
npx vite build
npm run test:e2e
```

Rebuild the server after Rust changes and the web app after frontend changes; the tests use
the last builds. Pass Playwright options after `--`, for example
`npm run test:e2e -- e2e/timeline.spec.ts --headed`. `TOODO_SERVER_BIN` points the tests at
another `toodo-server` binary and `TOODO_E2E_WEB_DIR` at another web build. After a failure,
`npx playwright show-report` opens the report.

## Tech Stack

Rust (tokio, axum) for `toodo-server`, React + TypeScript + React Flow for the web app,
SQLite. See [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md#platform-and-stack) for details.

## Releases

A release ships `toodo-server` together with the web app; servers update with
`scripts/install-server.sh --release latest` (see [docs/server.md](docs/server.md)).

To publish a release:

1. On `dev`, run `npm run bump <major|minor|patch|X.Y.Z>`. It sets the same version in
   `package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `src-tauri/Cargo.toml`, and
   `src-tauri/Cargo.lock`. Commit it as `Release X.Y.Z`. `npm run check-version` checks
   that the four files agree; the workflow runs it first.
2. Open a pull request from `dev` to `main` and merge it.
3. On every push to `main`, the `Release` workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
   releases the version in `package.json` unless it is already published: on Ubuntu it
   builds the web app (`npm run build`) and the x86_64 Linux `toodo-server`, packages
   them with `scripts/package-server.sh`, uploads
   `toodo-server-vX.Y.Z-linux-x86_64.tar.gz` and then its `.sha256`, and creates the
   release "Toodo vX.Y.Z" if it is missing. A push to `main` without a version bump does
   nothing.

Releases run from `main` rather than from tags so the Rust build cache of one release is
reused by the next. If a release fails, run the `Release` workflow by hand on `main`; it
completes a release whose server assets were not uploaded yet.

## Status

Early bootstrap. Setup instructions will be added with the project scaffold.
